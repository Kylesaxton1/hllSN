# Speakers Notes for Hors-La-Loi

## Introduction
> A controversial film directed by French-Algerian Rachid Bouchareb, depicting the lives of three Algerian brothers in the time leading up to the French-Algerian War. Made in collaboration with producers in France, Algeria, Tunisia, and Belgium, this film explores many of the events leading up to the French-Algerian War.

## Le Chef (Rachid Bouchareb)
> Born September 1st, 1953, Rachid Bouchareb is a French film director and producer, known for many films based upon the complex and long history between France and Algeria. Born in Paris, France, to Algerian parents, just over one year before the beginning of the French-Algerian war, Rachid began his life at a very troubling and divisive time. He began his career in 1997 as an assistant director for television in France's State Television. After some time he moved on to bigger things and started producing many films (La Vie de Jésus, Humanité, et Flanders). Also at this time, he directed many feature films. His biggest success [Days of Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Glory_(2006_film)) is the prequel to this film and shares many of the same actors.

## The Three Brother

### Messaoud (Played by Roschdy Zem)
> Messaoud is the brother who went to war and fought for France in Indochina. The events of this can be seen in another one of Rachid Bouchareb's films, [Days of Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Glory_(2006_film)). Messaoud is the most morally stable of the brothers. He goes to war, comes back, decides to start a family, works a living job. No, none of these three brothers are unquestionable, he had the most apprehensions about the things that they were doing because of his grounding, because of the foundation that he had built for himself. Messaoud simply wanted safety and security for his family. He worked to keep them safe and happy, while also working to better their situation in the long run.

### Abdelkader (Played by Sami Bouajila)
> Abdelkader is the brother who went to jail. Although it was he and Messaoud who organized the FLN, he was the head of the operation. Abdelkader wanted liberation for the Algerian people by any means necessary. He put the operation of the FLN before the progression of his own life. He sought not love, he sought not happiness, he sought not wealth. He sought foremost and solely the freedom of his people at the cost of anything. It is important to note that Abdelkader went to prison specifically _for_ his ideas in seeking Algerian independence. He witnessed firsthand how forcefully and violently held down the Algerian people were, ***especially*** when it came to their independence.

### Saïd (Played by Jamel Debouze)
> Saïd is the brother who stayed with their mother throughout the entire film. This being said, he is the most morally questionable of the three brothers. After the Sétif Massacre, it was Saïd who sought revenge on the man who forced them from their home, and it was him who relocated with their mother to France. In the time between the Sétif massacre and the rest of the film, Saïd took care of their mother and stayed with her. Instead of working for Renault like most other Algerians in France, Saïd turned to a more shady living, prostituting women and using them for profit. Later in the film, Saïd is revealed to be training a young Algerian boxer to compete against French boxers. He saw this as a symbolic victory and the first step towards equality for the Algerian people.

## The Sétif Massacre
> This event is juxtaposed with the announcement in France that WWII has ended and the celebration that followed. It is important to remember that these two events occurred on the same day -> In France, the French people celebrated victory from oppression, and in Algeria, the French murdered tens of thousands of civilians. It was interesting that the first person to be shot during the incident, was a little boy holding the flag of the FLN (or the Algerian Flag today), It was as if the flag itself was seen as a transgression against France and the French people.

## The Depiction of France
> Throughout the film, the French were depicted as antagonistic. Hypocritically so, starting at the juxtaposition of the celebrations in France with the Massacre in Sétif. To the secret police torturing, killing, and dehumanizing people who they _suspect_ to be associated with the FLN. To the bombing of Shantytown, the list goes on... culminating with the shootout at the end of the film and the murder of Messaoud and Abdelkader. Although the "protagonists" of this film were lit under a rather morally grey light, France was given a largely villainous role. Now, It must be noted that this film is not anti-France. This film is first and foremost anti-colonialism. The French were depicted as the antagonists of this film because they were a colonial power in Algeria. The Algerian people were promised greater self-rule after WWII and they never received it.

## Discussion Questions
1. A very strong theme in this film is that of promises not being held up. The exposition of this film contains the biggest broken promise that leads to
