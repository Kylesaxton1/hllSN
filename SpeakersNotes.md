# Speakers Notes for Hors-La-Loi

## Introduction
> A controversial film directed by French-Algerian Rachid Bouchareb, depicting the lives of three Algerian brothers in the time leading up to the French-Algerian War. Made in collaboration from producers in France, Algeria, Tunisia, and Belgium, this film explores many of the events leading up to French-Algerian War.

## The Three Brother
> The film follows the lives of three Algerian brothers, taking most of its time on their lives in France. The film begins with the three being forced out of their family home due to colonial settlers buying the land. After that, the film moved on to the Sétif Massacre occuring on May 8, 1945. All three brothers found themselves present at this massacre, each of them having separate experiences from this event. It is important to note that during this event, the three brothers lost their father, but also their two sisters. I believe that all three of these brothers represent a different apporach to the situation of colonial oppression.

### Messaoud (Played by Roschdy Zem)
> Messaoud is the brother who went to war and fought for France in Indochina. The events of this, can be seen in another one of Rachid Bouchareb's films, [Days of Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Glory_(2006_film)). I believe that Messaoud is the most morally stable of the brothers. He goes to war, comes back, decides to start a family, works a living job. Yes, I do belive that that none of these three brothers are unquestionable, but I beleive that he had the most aprehensions about the things that they were doing because of is grounding, because of the foundation that he had built for himself. Messaoud simply wanted safety and security for his family. He worked to keep them safe and happy, while also working to better their situation in the long run.

### Abdelkader (Played by Sami Bouajila)
> Abdelkader is the brother who went to jail. Although it was him and Messaoud who organized the FLN, he was the head of the operation. Abdelkader wanted liberation for the Algerian people by any means necessary. He put the operation of the FLN before the progression of his own life. He sought not love, he sought not happiness, he sought not wealth. He sought foremost and solely the freedom of his people at the cost of anything.

### Saïd (Played by Jamel Debouze)
> Saïd is the brother who stayed with their mother throughout the entire film. This being said, I believe that he is the most morally questionable of the three brothers. After the Sétif Massacre, it was Saïd who sought revenge on the man who forced them from their home, and it was him who relocated with their mother to France. In the time between the Sétif massacre and the rest of the film, Saïd took care of their mother and stayed with her. Instead of working for Renault like most other Algerians in France, Saïd turned to a more shady living, prostituting women and using them for profit. Later in the film, Saïd is revealed to be training a young Algerian boxer to compete against French boxers. He saw this as a symbolic victory and the first step towards equality for the Algerian people.

## The Sétif Massacre
> This event is juxtaposed with the announcement in France that WWII has ended and the celebration that followed. It is important to remember that these two events occuRred on the same day -> In France, the French people celebrated victory from oppression and in Algeria, the French murdered tens of thousands of civilians. I found it interesting that the first person to be shot during the incident, was a little boy holding the flag of the FLN (or the Algerian Flag today), It was as if the flag itself was seen as a transgression against France and the French people.

## France
> Throughout the film, the French were depicted as antagonistic. Hipocritically so, starting at the juxtaposition of the celebrations in France with the Massacre in Sétif. Following with delegation of the French-Algerian population to Shanty-Town. To the secret police torturing, killing and dehumanizing people who they _suspect_ to be associated with the FLN. With it all culminating with the shootout at the end of the film and the murder of Messaoud and Abdelkader.
